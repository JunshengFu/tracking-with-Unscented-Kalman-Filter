# **Object Tracking with Unscented Kalman Filter**

## Objective
Utilize sensor data from both LIDAR and RADAR measurements for object (e.g. pedestrian, vehicles, or other moving objects) 
tracking with the Unscented Kalman Filter.

### Unscented Kalman Filter example

## Kalman Filters variances

All Kalman filters have the same mains steps: 1. Initialization, 2. Prediction, 3. Update.
A **Standard Kalman Filter** (KF) can only handle linear equations. 
Both the **Extended Kalman Filter** (EKF) and the **Unscented Kalman Filter** allow you to use non-linear equations; the difference between 
EKF and UKF is how they handle non-linear equations: Extended Kalman Filter uses the Jacobian matrix to 
linearize non-linear functions; Unscented Kalman Filter, on the other hand, does not need to linearize non-linear 
functions, insteadly, the unscented Kalman filter takes representative points from a Gaussian distribution. 



## Unscented Kalman Filter VS Extended Kalman Filter

Table 1: Accuracy comparison in RMSE by using EKF and UKF with both lidar and radar measurements. The lidar and radar 
measurements are included in the txt file under the [data](data) folder. 

|            state        |  UKF          |    EKF     |
|:-----------------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
|            px           | **0.0640299** |  0.0972256 |
|            py           | **0.0832734** |  0.0853761 |
|            vx           | **0.330315**  |  0.450855  |
|            vy           | **0.212456**  |  0.450855  |

|           state         | lidar and radar | only lidar | only radar|
|:-----------------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:---------:|
|            px           | **0.0640299**   |  0.168267  |  0.203744 |
|            py           | **0.0832734**   |  0.146901  |  0.250427 |
|            vx           | **0.330315**    |  0.613026  |  0.450143 |
|            vy           | **0.212456**    |  0.252216  |  0.249284 |



**Conclusions from aboves**:

* From Table 1, we can see the UKF outperform EKF in estimation of all states.
* From Table 2, we can see that ultizing both lidar and radar measurements improves the tracking results.
